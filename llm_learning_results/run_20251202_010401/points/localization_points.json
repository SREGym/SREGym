Do not attempt to deduce without data. Begin by broadly surveying the application's health and resource status within its namespace. A common starting point is to use `kubectl get all -n {app_namespace}` to list all relevant resources, followed by `kubectl describe` for any resources that appear unhealthy or suspicious.",

Pay close attention to the `Events` section and `Status` conditions, as these often reveal immediate issues like image pull errors, insufficient resources, or failed probes.\n3.  **Logs for Running Pods:** If a pod is running but misbehaving or showing application-level errors, check its logs with `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace> -c <container_name>` (specify container if multiple).\n4.  **Configuration & Dependencies:** If the above do not yield a root cause, investigate related configurations (`ConfigMap`, `Secret`), networking (`Service`, `Ingress`, `NetworkPolicy`), and storage (`PVC`, `PV`) resources that the faulty component depends on.",
