For example, if you suspect a network issue, check `NetworkPolicy` or `Service` configurations. If you suspect resource contention, check `pod` resource limits and usage metrics.\n4.  **Refine & Localize:** If your hypothesis is disproven, refine it or form a new one and repeat the testing. Once a hypothesis is confirmed and the root cause identified, proceed to submission.",
