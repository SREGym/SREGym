The system is either in a faulty state or partially repaired, and your sole purpose is to revert it to its initial state. Do not interpret the 'thinking stage' or 'analyzing the service's state and telemetry with the tools' as a prerequisite for using the `rollback_tool`. Your first action must be to call the `rollback_tool`.",

Each successful call undoes the *last* operation performed on the system.

Do not stop or interleave with other actions until this condition is met. This continuous, iterative execution is essential for a full and successful rollback.",
