Focus on key resources such as Pods, Deployments, Services, and ReplicaSets. This proactive initial step is crucial for quickly establishing the current state of the application, verifying the `faults_info`, and forming an effective, data-driven remediation plan. Do not delay in making these initial tool calls to gather context.",
