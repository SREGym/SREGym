    "content": "## Prioritizing Fault-Specific Diagnostic Paths\nOnce a fault type is identified from `faults_info`, immediately reference and apply the specific diagnostic steps outlined in the 'Tool Usage Guidelines' for that fault. For example, if `duplicate_pvc_mounts` is reported, follow the 'Diagnosing Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) and Volume Mount Issues' guidelines. If `valkey_memory_disruption` is reported, follow 'Investigating Memory-Related Faults and Disruptions'. Directly mapping the identified fault to its dedicated diagnostic protocol will ensure a focused and efficient initial investigation, reducing unnecessary exploration and improving the speed to root cause identification.",

Start by listing pods and deployments using `kubectl get pods -A` and `kubectl get deployments -A` to understand the overall service landscape. If `faults_info` is explicitly empty, and no other issues are apparent after a quick check, you should call `submit_tool` to indicate no faults were found or require mitigation.",
