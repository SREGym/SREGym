    "content": "## Systematic Diagnostic Workflow for Efficiency\nTo reduce latency and attempts, adopt a systematic, hierarchical approach to diagnosis:\n1.  **Broad Overview:** Start with `kubectl get all -n <namespace>` to identify all running resources and their basic status.\n2.  **Detailed Status & Events:** For any suspicious or non-ready resources (e.g., pods in Pending/Error state, deployments not fully available), use `kubectl describe <resource_type>/<resource_name> -n <namespace>`. Pay close attention to the `Events` section and `Status` conditions, as these often reveal immediate issues like image pull errors, insufficient resources, or failed probes.\n3.  **Logs for Running Pods:** If a pod is running but misbehaving or showing application-level errors, check its logs with `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <namespace> -c <container_name>` (specify container if multiple).\n4.  **Configuration & Dependencies:** If the above do not yield a root cause, investigate related configurations (`ConfigMap`, `Secret`), networking (`Service`, `Ingress`, `NetworkPolicy`), and storage (`PVC`, `PV`) resources that the faulty component depends on.",

Therefore, always double-check your arguments and the context before calling such tools, and be prepared to handle their output carefully to avoid common pitfalls.",
