Review relevant metrics if available.\n4.  **Correlate and Isolate**: Connect observations across different components and data sources to narrow down potential root causes. Consider dependencies between microservices and shared infrastructure.\n5.  **Verify Root Cause**: Before submitting a diagnosis, ensure the identified root cause fully explains all observed symptoms and that no other significant issues remain unaddressed within the problem scope. Confirm that fixing this root cause would resolve the incident.",
