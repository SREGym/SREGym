Utilize `kubectl get pods -n {app_namespace}`, `kubectl get deployments -n {app_namespace}`, and `kubectl get services -n {app_namespace}`. This essential step establishes context and provides immediate visibility into the application's running state, which is crucial before delving into specific issues or metrics.",
