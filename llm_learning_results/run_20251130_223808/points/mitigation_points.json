    "content": "## Structured Initial Diagnosis and Verification\nUpon receiving `faults_info`, begin by systematically verifying the reported components and their immediate environment. \n1.  **List Resources**: Use `kubectl get pods,deployments,services,replicasets -n {app_namespace}` (and potentially other resource types if relevant to the fault) to confirm the existence and basic status of the affected components.\n2.  **Describe Resources**: For each identified problematic resource (e.g., a specific pod or deployment), use `kubectl describe <resource_type> <resource_name> -n {app_namespace}`. Pay close attention to:\n    *   **Events**: Look for recent errors, warnings, or status changes.\n    *   **Resource Limits/Requests**: Especially for CPU or memory related issues, check if these are configured appropriately (as highlighted by the `astronomy_shop_ad_service_high_cpu` failure).\n    *   **Status Conditions**: Verify the current state of the resource.\nThis structured approach helps quickly confirm the fault's context and gather critical initial data before diving into logs or metrics.",

    "content": "## Targeted Troubleshooting for Specific Fault Types\nWhen `faults_info` or initial diagnostics point to specific problem categories, prioritize these targeted checks:\n*   **Network Connectivity Issues (`network_policy_block`)**: If the fault involves connectivity problems (e.g., service unreachable, timeouts), immediately check for Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy` resources using `kubectl get networkpolicies -n {app_namespace}`. Inspect their rules to identify potential blocking policies.\n*   **Memory Disruptions (`valkey_memory_disruption`)**: For memory-related faults, beyond checking `kubectl describe pod` for OOMKills, leverage `kubectl top pod -n {app_namespace}` to observe real-time memory usage. Also, review pod logs for application-specific memory errors or excessive memory allocation warnings.\n*   **Concurrent Failures Across Services (`social_net_hotel_res_astro_shop_concurrent_failures`)**: If multiple distinct services or applications are reported as failing concurrently, expand your investigation beyond a single service or namespace. Consider shared dependencies (e.g., databases, message queues), cluster-wide resource exhaustion, or common infrastructure issues. Use `kubectl get all -A` or target related namespaces explicitly to identify broader impacts.",
