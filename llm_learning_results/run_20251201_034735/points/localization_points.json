    "content": "## Initial Diagnostic Strategy\nTo begin your diagnosis, always start by listing the core resources in the application's namespace using tools like `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl get deployments`, and `kubectl get services`. This provides an immediate overview of the application's structure, running components, and their initial health status. Look for pods in `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Pending`, or `Error` states, and deployments with fewer ready replicas than desired. This initial broad sweep can quickly narrow down the scope of investigation.",
