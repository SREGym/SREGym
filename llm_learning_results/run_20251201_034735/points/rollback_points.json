Unlike other agents, you **do not** need to analyze service state or telemetry at the beginning of your task. Your first and immediate action must be to call the `rollback` tool. Any thinking or analysis that delays the execution of the `rollback` tool is counterproductive to your mission. Begin by calling the `rollback` tool without any preceding diagnostic steps.",

Do not stop calling the `rollback` tool prematurely. Only after receiving this specific 'no more operations' confirmation should you proceed to call `submit_tool` with an empty dictionary (`{\"ans\": {}}`). Ensure you process the output of each `rollback` call to determine if further calls are needed.",
