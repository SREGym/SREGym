    "content": "## Learned Insights: Prioritize Tool-Based Verification and Root Cause Analysis\nGiven the identified faults in `{faults_info}`, your immediate and critical first step is to leverage the provided tools to *empirically verify* the fault information and initiate root cause analysis. Do not attempt to reason about the faults solely based on the description; concrete data from the cluster is essential. Begin by using `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` on the specific resources (pods, deployments, services, etc.) mentioned in `faults_info` within the `{app_namespace}`. This active data gathering is essential for moving forward and formulating any effective remediation plan. Remember, 'analyzing the service's state and telemetry' means using your tools, not just internal reasoning.",

    "content": "## Learned Insights: Targeted Investigation Based on Fault Type\nTo reduce unnecessary tool calls and accelerate mitigation, tailor your initial investigation based on the type of fault identified. Always use tools to gather specific information:\n- **NetworkPolicy Issues**: Immediately execute `kubectl get networkpolicies -n {app_namespace}` to list and inspect the network policies in the affected namespace.\n- **CPU-Related Problems**: Before examining detailed metrics, first check the resource requests and limits configured for the affected pods using `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n {app_namespace}`. Misconfigurations here are often primary causes.\n- **Concurrent Failures Across Services**: When multiple services or applications are experiencing concurrent failures (e.g., `social_net_hotel_res_astro_shop_concurrent_failures`), meticulously check all affected application namespaces and verify the health and configuration of each service independently. This often requires a broader `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` across multiple components.",
