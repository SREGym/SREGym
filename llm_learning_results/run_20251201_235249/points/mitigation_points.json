    "content": "## Starting Mitigation: Prioritize Targeted Tool Calls for Fault Verification\nUpon receiving the `faults_info`, your immediate first action should be to use specific tools to verify the reported faults and gather immediate context within the affected namespace. Do not attempt to analyze or infer without first querying the environment. For general fault verification, `kubectl describe` on affected resources (e.g., pods, deployments, services) is often a good starting point to check status, events, and resource configurations. If `faults_info` points to a specific pod, `kubectl logs <pod_name> -n <app_namespace>` can provide immediate diagnostic data. Always target your initial tool calls based on the `faults_info` provided by the diagnosis agent.",
