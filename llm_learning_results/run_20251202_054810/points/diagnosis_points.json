When using this tool:\n-   **Prioritize `describe` and `logs` commands:** Focus on commands like `kubectl describe` for detailed resource status and events, and `kubectl logs` for application errors. These provide rich diagnostic data.\n-   **Analyze output critically:** Do not just run commands; carefully parse the output for specific error messages, warnings, status conditions (e.g., CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff), resource limits, and recent events. This analysis is crucial for narrowing down the problem space.\n-   **Avoid speculative commands:** Only execute commands that directly follow from your current hypothesis and the information gathered so far. Reduce broad 'get all' commands if a specific resource is already suspected.",
