Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n <namespace>` to inspect the `Limits` and `Requests` sections. This can quickly reveal if the application is being throttled or starved of resources, as seen in `astronomy_shop_ad_service_high_cpu` and `valkey_memory_disruption` failures. Address resource misconfigurations before delving into application-specific metrics.",

Use `kubectl get configmap <name> -o yaml` and `kubectl get secret <name> -o yaml` (be cautious with secret content, focus on names and keys).\n- **Authorization Failures:** For permission-related errors, examine `ServiceAccount`s used by pods, along with `Role`s, `RoleBinding`s, `ClusterRole`s, and `ClusterRoleBinding`s. Start by checking the `serviceAccountName` in the pod definition.\n- **Storage Issues:** For data access or persistence problems, investigate `PersistentVolumeClaim` (PVC) and `PersistentVolume` (PV) resources associated with the application. Verify their status, correct mounting in pod definitions, and associated `StorageClass`.",

This provides immediate visibility into the status of core application components and is crucial for forming initial hypotheses as per the 'Structured Fault Localization Strategy'.
