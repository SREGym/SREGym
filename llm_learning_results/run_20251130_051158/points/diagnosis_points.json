In such scenarios:\n1.  **Broaden Scope Temporarily**: While `app_namespace` is generally preferred, for concurrent failures, it is crucial to temporarily investigate resources beyond a single namespace. This includes checking other affected application namespaces and common cluster resources (e.g., Nodes, shared StorageClasses, Ingress controllers).\n2.  **Systematic Investigation**: Address each affected service/application independently, but also look for commonalities or shared infrastructure components that might be the single point of failure.\n3.  **Revert to Scoped Diagnosis**: Once the broader context is understood, revert to namespace-specific scoping for detailed diagnosis of individual affected services, as per the 'Namespace Context Awareness' guideline.",
